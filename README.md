<H3>VBA script for Photo Dept</H3>
Christian Aranda

This is a VBA script to find specific images in a large file structure of images.
Ideal template for a large scale ecommerce and small businesses.

This repository includes both a template with the VBA code already embeded in the excel and the raw VBA code in a text file.

How to used the template:
Under "SKU" look up the file name of the image and the "Brand" would be the parent folder of where this image would be located.
The results would be displayed in the left three columns with "Exists in folder" if the image is found, "Folder not found" if the parent folder was not found, and blank if the parent folder was found, but not the image itself.
